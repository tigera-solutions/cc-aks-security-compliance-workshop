# Microsoft Azure: Hands-on AKS workshop </br> Configuration Security and Compliance

In this AKS-focused workshop, you will work with Microsoft Azure and Calico Cloud to learn how to design and deploy best practices to secure your Kubernetes environment and achieve compliance with regulatory frameworks such as PCI, SOC2 and GDPR. This 90-minute hands-on lab will guide you from building an AKS cluster, creating a Calico Cloud trial account and registering your AKS cluster to Calico Cloud for configuring and securing it for compliance. A sample application environment is designed to help implement:

- Configuration security including Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) 
- Security policies for compliance
- Compliance, evidence, and audit reporting

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications in Microsoft Azure, along with best practices that you can implement in your organization.

# How Calico supports compliance requirements

Tigera’s solutions, Calico Cloud and Calico Enterprise, enable north-south controls such as egress access, east-west controls such as microsegmentation, and enterprise security controls, policy enforcement, and compliance reporting across all Kubernetes distributions in both hybrid and multi-cloud environments. 

- [Download the whitepaper: PCI compliance for Hosts, VMs, containers, and Kubernetes](https://www.tigera.io/lp/kubernetes-pci-compliance/)
- [Download the PCI DSS v4.0 Quick Reference Guide](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Supporting%20Document/PCI_DSS-QRG-v4_0.pdf)

Calico provides the following features to help achieve PCI compliance.

---

## Access controls

Calico provides methods to enable fine-grained access controls between your microservices and external databases, cloud services, APIs, and other applications that are protected behind a firewall. You can enforce controls from within the cluster using DNS egress policies, from a firewall outside the cluster using the egress gateway. Controls are applied on a fine-grained, per-pod basis.

### Zero trust Security

| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7.1, 7.2 | Restrict access to cardholder data by business need to know | • Use zero trust security features to implement a default-deny model (access to all data services should be specifically allowed; everything else should be denied)<br>• Follow a zero trust security model and implement least-privilege access (all processes should only be able to access information necessary for their legitimate purpose)

A global default deny policy ensures that unwanted traffic (ingress and egress) is denied by default. Pods without policy (or incorrect policy) are not allowed traffic until appropriate network policy is defined. Although the staging policy tool will help you find incorrect and missing policy, a global deny helps mitigate against other lateral malicious attacks.

By default, all traffic is allowed between the pods in a cluster. First, let's test connectivity between application components and across application stacks. All of these tests should succeed as there are no policies in place.

a. Test connectivity between workloads within each namespace, use dev and default namespaces as example

   ```bash
   # test connectivity within dev namespace, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" 
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://nginx-svc 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   ```bash
   # test connectivity within default namespace in 8080 port
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl -n default get po -l app=frontend -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
   -c server -- sh -c 'nc -zv recommendationservice 8080'
   ```

b. Test connectivity across namespaces dev/centos and default/frontend.

   ```bash
   # test connectivity from dev namespace to default namespace, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://frontend.default 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

c. Test connectivity from each namespace dev and default to the Internet.

   ```bash
   # test connectivity from dev namespace to the Internet, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   ```bash
   # test connectivity from default namespace to the Internet, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get po -l app=loadgenerator -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
   -c main -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

We recommend that you create a global default deny policy after you complete writing policy for the traffic that you want to allow. Use the stage policy feature to get your allowed traffic working as expected, then lock down the cluster to block unwanted traffic.

1. Create a staged global default deny policy. It will shows all the traffic that would be blocked if it were converted into a deny.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: StagedGlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: default-deny
   spec:
     order: 2000
     selector: "projectcalico.org/namespace in {'dev','default','storefront'}"
     types:
     - Ingress
     - Egress
   EOF
   ```

   You should be able to view the potential affect of the staged default-deny policy if you navigate to the Dashboard view in the Enterprise Manager UI and look at the Packets by Policy histogram.

   ```bash
   # make a request across namespaces and view Packets by Policy histogram, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   for i in {1..5}; do kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://frontend.default 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'; sleep 2; done
   ```

   The staged policy does not affect the traffic directly but allows you to view the policy impact if it were to be enforced. You can see the deny traffic in staged policy.


2. Create other network policies to individually allow the traffic shown as blocked in step 1, until no connections are denied.
  
   Apply network policies to your application with explicity allow and deny control.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF   
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: default.centos
     namespace: dev
   spec:
     tier: default
     order: 800
     selector: app == "centos"
     egress:
     - action: Allow
       protocol: TCP
       destination:
         selector: app == "nginx"
     types:
       - Egress
   EOF
   ```

   Test connectivity with policies in place.

   a. The only connections between the components within namespaces dev are from centos to nginx, which should be allowed as configured by the policies.

   ```bash
   # test connectivity within dev namespace, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://nginx-svc 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```
   
   The connections within namespace default should be allowed as usual.
   
   ```bash
   # test connectivity within default namespace in 8080 port
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get po -l app=frontend -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
   -c server -- sh -c 'nc -zv recommendationservice 8080'
   ``` 

   b. The connections across dev/centos pod and default/frontend pod should be blocked by the application policy.
   
   ```bash   
   # test connectivity from dev namespace to default namespace, the expected result is "command terminated with exit code 1"
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://frontend.default 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   c. Test connectivity from each namespace dev and default to the Internet.
   
   ```bash   
   # test connectivity from dev namespace to the Internet, the expected result is "command terminated with exit code 1"
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```
   
   ```bash
   # test connectivity from default namespace to the Internet, the expected result is "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get po -l app=loadgenerator -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') \
   -c main -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   Implement explicitic policy to allow egress access from a workload in one namespace/pod, e.g. dev/centos, to default/frontend.
   
   a. Deploy egress policy between two namespaces dev and default.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: platform.centos-to-frontend
     namespace: dev
   spec:
     tier: platform
     order: 100
     selector: app == "centos"
     egress:
       - action: Allow
         protocol: TCP
         source: {}
         destination:
           selector: app == "frontend"
           namespaceSelector: projectcalico.org/name == "default"
       - action: Pass
     types:
       - Egress
   EOF
   ```

   b. Test connectivity between dev/centos pod and default/frontend service again, should be allowed now.

   ```bash   
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -sI http://frontend.default 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   #output is HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   ```

   Apply the policies to allow the microservices to communicate with each other.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/east-west-traffic.yaml
   ```

3. Use the Calico Cloud GUI to enforce the default-deny staged policy. After enforcing a staged policy, it takes effect immediatelly. The default-deny policy will start to actually deny traffic.

### Ingress and Egress access control using NetworkSets


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5, 1.3.7 | Prohibit and/or manage access between internet and CDE | • Whitelist ingress access from the public internet only if the endpoint is providing a publicly accessible service<br>• Whitelist egress access to the public internet from all in-covered components<br>• Protect against forged source IP addresses with WireGuard (integrated in Calico)|

1. Implement DNS policy to allow the external endpoint access from a specific workload, e.g. `dev/centos`.

   a. Apply a policy to allow access to `api.twilio.com` endpoint using DNS rule.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: security.external-domain-access
   spec:
     tier: security
     selector: (app == "centos" && projectcalico.org/namespace == "dev")
     order: 100
     types:
       - Egress
     egress:
     - action: Allow
       source:
         selector: app == 'centos'
       destination:
         domains:
         - '*.twilio.com'
   EOF
   ```
   
   Test the access to the endpoints:

   ```bash
   # test egress access to api.twilio.com
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://api.twilio.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   ```bash
   # test egress access to www.google.com
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   Access to the `api.twilio.com` endpoint should be allowed by the DNS policy and any other external endpoints like `www.google.com` should be denied.

   b. Modify the policy to include `*.google.com` in dns policy and test egress access to www.google.com again.

   ```bash
   # test egress access to www.google.com again and it should be allowed.
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

2. Edit the policy to use a `NetworkSet` with DNS domain instead of inline DNS rule.

   a. Apply a policy to allow access to `api.twilio.com` endpoint using DNS policy.

   Deploy the Network Set

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   kind: GlobalNetworkSet
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   metadata:
     name: allowed-dns
     labels: 
       type: allowed-dns
   spec:
     allowedEgressDomains:
     - '*.twilio.com'
   EOF
   ```

   b. Deploy the DNS policy using the network set

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: security.external-domain-access
   spec:
     tier: security
     selector: (app == "centos" && projectcalico.org/namespace == "dev")
     order: 100
     types:
       - Egress
     egress:
     - action: Allow
       destination:
         selector: type == "allowed-dns"
   EOF
   ```

   c. Test the access to the endpoints.

   ```bash
   # test egress access to api.twilio.com
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://api.twilio.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   ```bash
   # test egress access to www.google.com
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

   d. Modify the `NetworkSet` to include `*.google.com` in dns domain and test egress access to www.google.com again.

   ```bash
   # test egress access to www.google.com again and it should be allowed.
   kubectl -n dev exec -t centos -- sh -c 'curl -m3 -skI https://www.google.com 2>/dev/null | grep -i http'
   ```

3. The NetworkSet can also be used to block access from a specific ip address or cidr to an endpoint in your cluster. To demonstrate it, we are going to block the access from your workstation to the Online Boutique frontend-external service.

   a. Test the access to the frontend-external service

   ```bash
   curl -sI -m3 $(kubectl get svc frontend-external -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}') | grep -i http
   ```
   
   b. Identify your workstation ip address and store it in a environment variable

   ```bash
   export MY_IP=$(curl ifconfig.me)
   ```

   c. Create a NetworkSet with your ip address on it.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   kind: GlobalNetworkSet
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   metadata:
     name: ip-address-list
     labels: 
       type: blocked-ips
   spec:
     nets:
     - $MY_IP/32
   EOF
   ```
   
   d. Create the policy to deny access to the frontend service.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: security.blockep-ips
   spec:
     tier: security
     selector: app == "frontend"
     order: 300
     types:
       - Ingress
     ingress:
     - action: Deny
       source:
         selector: type == "blocked-ips"
       destination: {}
   EOF
   ```

   e. Create a global alert for the blocked attempt from the ip-address-list to the frontend.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF   
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalAlert
   metadata:
     name: blocked-ips
   spec:
     description: "A connection attempt from a blocked ip address just happened."
     summary: "[blocked-ip] ${source_ip} from ${source_name_aggr} networkset attempted to access ${dest_namespace}/${dest_name_aggr}"
     severity: 100
     dataSet: flows
     period: 1m
     lookback: 1m
     query: '(source_name = "ip-address-list")'
     aggregateBy: [dest_namespace, dest_name_aggr, source_name_aggr, source_ip]
     field: num_flows
     metric: sum
     condition: gt
     threshold: 0
   EOF
   ```

   a. Test the access to the frontend-external service. It is blocked now. Wait a few minutes and check the `Activity > Alerts`.

   ```bash
   curl -sI -m3 $(kubectl get svc frontend-external -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}') | grep -i http
   ```

### Using Global Threatfeeds to detect and prevent web attacks


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6.5, 6.6 | Detect and prevent web attacks | • Use policy to implement fine-grained access controls for services |

1. Protect workloads with GlobalThreatfeed from known bad actors.

   Calicocloud offers [Global Threatfeed](https://docs.tigera.io/reference/resources/globalthreatfeed) resource to prevent known bad actors from accessing Kubernetes pods.

   ```bash
   kubectl get globalthreatfeeds
   ```

   >Output is 
   ```bash
   NAME                           CREATED AT
   alienvault.domainthreatfeeds   2021-09-28T15:01:33Z
   alienvault.ipthreatfeeds       2021-09-28T15:01:33Z
   ```

   You can get these domain/ip list from yaml file, the url would be:

   ```bash
   kubectl get globalthreatfeeds alienvault.domainthreatfeeds -ojson | jq -r '.spec.pull.http.url'
   kubectl get globalthreatfeeds alienvault.ipthreatfeeds -ojson | jq -r '.spec.pull.http.url'
   ```

   >Output is 
   ```bash
   https://installer.calicocloud.io/feeds/v1/domains

   https://installer.calicocloud.io/feeds/v1/ips
   ```

   1. Deploy the feodo Threatfeed

      ```yaml
      kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
      apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
      kind: GlobalThreatFeed
      metadata:
        name: feodo-tracker
      spec:
        pull:
          http:
            url: https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/ipblocklist.txt
        globalNetworkSet:
          labels:
            threatfeed: feodo
      EOF
      ```

   2. Deploy the policy to block traffic from and to feodo Threatfeed

      ```yaml
      kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
      apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
      kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: security.block-threadfeed
      spec:
        tier: security
        order: 210
        selector: all()
        types:
        - Egress
        egress:
        - action: Deny
          destination:
            selector: threatfeed == "feodo"
      EOF
      ```

   3. Confirm and check the tracker threatfeed
   
      ```bash
      kubectl get globalthreatfeeds 
      ```
   
      ```bash
      NAME                           CREATED AT
      alienvault.domainthreatfeeds   2022-02-11T19:21:26Z
      alienvault.ipthreatfeeds       2022-02-11T19:21:26Z
      feodo-tracker                  2022-02-11T22:21:43Z 
      ```
    
2. Generate alerts by accessing the IP from `feodo-tracker` list. 

   ```bash
   # try to ping any of the IPs in from the feodo tracker list.
   FIP=$(kubectl get globalnetworkset threatfeed.feodo-tracker -ojson | jq -r '.spec.nets[0]' | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/\/32//')
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "ping -c1 $FIP"
   ```
<!--   -->
3. Generate alerts by accessing the IP from `alienvault.ipthreatfeeds` list. 

   ```bash
   # try to ping any of the IPs in from the ipthreatfeeds list.
   AIP=$(kubectl get globalnetworkset threatfeed.alienvault.ipthreatfeeds -ojson | jq -r '.spec.nets[0]' | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//' -e 's/\/32//')
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "ping -c1 $AIP"
   ```

4. Confirm you are able to see the alerts in alert list.

## Microsegmentation

Calico eliminates the risks associated with lateral movement in the cluster to prevent access to sensitive data and other assets. Calico provides a unified, cloud-native segmentation model and single policy framework that works seamlessly across multiple application and workload environments. It enables faster response to security threats
with a cloud-native architecture that can dynamically enforce security policy changes across cloud environments in milliseconds in response to an attack.


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
|1.1, 1.1.4, 1.1.6, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 | Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data | • Identify everything covered by PCI requirements with a well-defined label (e.g. PCI=true)<br>• Block all traffic between PCI and non-PCI workloads<br>• Whitelist all traffic within PCI workloads |

 
### Microsegmentation using label PCI = true on a namespace

1. For the microsegmentation deploy a new example application

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/storefront-pci.yaml
   ```

2. Verify that all the workloads has the label `PCI=true`.

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n storefront --show-labels
   ```

3. Create a policy that only allows endpoints with label PCI=true to communicate.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: security.pci-whitelist
   spec:
     tier: security
     order: 120
     namespaceSelector: kubernetes.io/metadata.name == "storefront"
     ingress:
       - action: Allow
         source:
           selector: PCI == "true"
         destination:
           selector: PCI == "true"
     egress:
       - action: Allow
         source:
           selector: PCI == "true"
         destination:
           selector: PCI == "true"
     types:
       - Ingress
       - Egress
   EOF
   ```

Now only the pods labeled with PCI=true will be able to exchange information. Note that you can use different labels to create any sort of restrictions for the workloads communications.

---

## IDS/IPS

Calico pinpoints the source of malicious activity, uses machine learning to identify anomalies, creates a security moat
around critical workloads, deploys honeypods to capture zero-day attacks, and automatically quarantines potentially
malicious workloads to thwart an attack. It monitors inbound and outbound traffic (north-south) and east-west traffic
that is traversing the cluster environment. Calico provides threat feed integration and custom alerts, and can be
configured to trigger automatic remediation.


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 10.6, 11.4 | Protect all systems against malware with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and network monitoring. Regularly update antivirus software. Review logs for anomalous and suspicious activity | • Detect and address anomalies and threats with Calico instead of antivirus software <br>• Report and analyze compliance audit findings with Calico<br>• Automatically quarantine compromised workloads<br>• Get insights into statistical and behavioral anomalies with Calico flow logs

### Deep Packet Inspection

1. Create the DPI and the Intrusion Detection for the dev/nginx service.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f - <<-EOF
   apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
   kind: DeepPacketInspection
   metadata:
     name: dpi-nginx
     namespace: dev
   spec:
     selector: app == "nginx"
   ---
   apiVersion: operator.tigera.io/v1
   kind: IntrusionDetection
   metadata:
     name: tigera-secure
   spec:
     componentResources:
     - componentName: DeepPacketInspection
       resourceRequirements:
         limits:
           cpu: "1"
           memory: 1Gi
         requests:
           cpu: 100m
           memory: 100Mi
   EOF
   ```

2. Attack the nginx service

   [Sid 1-21562 - MALWARE-CNC Win.Trojan.Bredolab variant outbound connection](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-21562) 
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "curl -m2 http://nginx-svc/ -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0' -XPOST --data-raw 'smk=1234'"
   ```

   [Sid 1-57461 - MALWARE-BACKDOOR Perl.Backdoor.PULSECHECK variant cnc connection](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-57461)
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "curl -m2 http://nginx-svc/secid_canceltoken.cgi -H 'X-CMD: Test' -H 'X-KEY: Test' -XPOST"
   ```

   [Sid 1-1002 - SERVER-IIS cmd.exe access](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-1002)
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "curl -m2 http://nginx-svc/cmd.exe"
   ```
   
   [Sid 1-2585 - SERVER-WEBAPP nessus 2.x 404 probe](https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-2585)  
   ```bash
   kubectl -n dev exec -t netshoot -- sh -c "curl -m2 http://nginx-svc/NessusTest"
   ```

## Policy lifecycle management


With Calico, teams can create, preview, and deploy security policies based on the characteristics and metadata
of a workload. These policies can provide an automated and scalable way to manage and isolate workloads for
security and compliance, in adherence with PCI compliance requirements. You can automate a validation step that
ensures your security policy works properly before being committed. Calico can deploy your policies in a “staged”
mode that will display which traffic is being allowed or denied before the policy rule is enforced. The policy can then
be committed if it is operating properly. This step avoids any potential problems caused by incorrect, incomplete, or
conflicting security policy definitions.


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1, 1.1.5, 1.1.7 | A formal process for approving and testing all network connections and changes to the rule sets | • Use Calico to record and review all policy changes that affect connectivity between covered components |
| 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 | Implement and record audit trail for all access to system components | • Record all policy changes that impact connectivity to/from in-scope assets with Calico |

1. Open a policy and check the change log

## Encryption

Calico’s data-in-transit encryption provides category-leading performance and lower CPU utilization than legacy
approaches based on IPsec and OpenVPN tunneling protocols. No matter where a threat originates, data encrypted
by Calico is unreadable to anyone except the legitimate keyholder, thus protecting sensitive data should a perimeter
breach occur. It enables compliance with corporate and regulatory data protection requirements, such as PCI, that
specify the use of encryption. Calico’s encryption is 6X faster than any other solution on the market.

| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1 | Data-in-transit encryption to safeguard sensitive data | • Secure and encrypt data in transit for all covered workloads|


1. On AKS, the WireGuard is already installed in Ubuntu nodes.

2. Enable WireGuard for the cluster

   ```bash
   kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true}}'
   ```

3. Verify if enabled

   ```bash
   NODENAME=$(kubectl get nodes -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
   kubectl get node $NODENAME -o yaml | grep -B2 -A5 annotation
   ```

4. Enable stats collection

   ```bash
   kubectl patch installation.operator.tigera.io default --type merge -p '{"spec":{"nodeMetricsPort":9091}}'
   ```

5. Apply Service, ServiceMonitor, NetworkPolicy manifests:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f manifests/wireguard-stats.yaml
   ```

6. Disable WireGuard for the cluster
   ```bash
   kubectl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":false}}'
   ```

## Compliance Reports

Continuous compliance means employing a continual audit that shows what traffic was allowed in your infrastructure,
what traffic was denied and why, and logs of who was trying to change what and whether those changes went into
effect. Continuous compliance gives teams the ability to pinpoint any point in time and say with reasonable certainty
whether the organization was in compliance—and provide documentation to prove it. Calico’s compliance reports
visually describe the security controls in place in an easy-to-understand policy view. Calico also shows all workloads
that are in-scope and out-of-scope with your policy.


| PCI Control # | Requirements| How Calico meets this requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.2, 2.4 | Inventory the systems and make sure they meet industry-accepted system-hardening standards | • Keep a running inventory of all ephemeral workloads along with their networking and security controls<br>• Leverage inventory report and CIS|

1. On the Calico Cloud GUI, navigate to `Compliance`.
